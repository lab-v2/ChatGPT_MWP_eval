We can express the value of the brass in terms of the prices of copper and zinc: \n\n0.65x + 0.3y = 3150   (equation 2)\n\nNow we can solve for x and y by using substitution. From equation 1, we know that y = 70 - x. We can substitute this into equation 2: \n\n0.65x + 0.3(70 - x) = 3150 \n\n0.65x + 21 - 0.3x = 3150 \n\n0.35x = 3129 \n\nx = 8940 \n\nSubstituting x = 8940 into equation 1: \n\n8940 + y = 70 \n\ny = 70 - 8940 = -8870 \n\nSince we can't have negative pounds of zinc, there must be an error in our calculations. Double-checking the calculations, we can see that the value of y should be 70 - x, not 70 - y: \n\n0.65x + 0.3(70 - x) = 3150 \n\n0.65x + 21 - 0.3x = 3150 \n\n0.35x = 3129 \n\nx = 8940 \n\nSubstituting x = 8940 into equation 1: \n\n8940 + y = 70 \n\ny = 70 - 8940 = -8870 \n\nNow we can see that the number of pounds of zinc is -8870, which is clearly impossible. \n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or in the calculations.",

    "final_answer": "Let's use variables to represent the number of pounds of peanuts and fancy nuts that Keil should buy. \n\nLet's call the number of pounds of peanuts \"p\" and the number of pounds of fancy nuts \"f\". \n\nWe know that the total amount of mixed nuts that Keil wants to make is 13 pounds, so we can write: \n\np + f = 13 \n\nWe also know that peanuts cost 2.00 per pound and fancy nuts cost 7.50 per pound, and Keil can only spend 70.00 on nuts. This means that the total cost of the peanuts and fancy nuts should be 70.00: \n\n2p + 7.5f = 70 \n\nNow we have two equations: \n\np + f = 13 \n2p + 7.5f = 70 \n\nWe can use substitution or elimination to solve for p and f. \n\nLet's use elimination. We can multiply the first equation by 2 to make the p terms in the two equations cancel each other out: \n\n2p + 2f = 26 \n2p + 7.5f = 70 \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second, we get: \n\n5.5f = 44 \n\nDividing both sides by 5.5: \n\nf = 8 \n\nSubstituting this value of f into p + f = 13, we get: \n\np + 8 = 13 \n\np = 5 \n\nSo Keil should buy 5 pounds of peanuts and 8 pounds of fancy nuts. \n\nTo check our answer, we can verify that the total amount of mixed nuts is indeed 13 pounds: \n\n5 + 8 = 13 \n\nAnd we can verify that the total cost of the peanuts and fancy nuts is indeed 70.00: \n\n2(5) + 7.5(8) = 10 + 60 = 70 \n\nSo our answer of 5 pounds of peanuts and 8 pounds of fancy nuts is correct.",

The cost of the $7.28 coffee is $7.28 per pound, and the cost of the $6.42 coffee is $6.42 per pound, so the average cost of the mixture should be:\n\n($7.28x + $6.42(7)) / (x + 7) = $7.20\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$7.28x + $44.94 = $7.20x + $50.40\n\nSubtracting $7.20x and $44.94 from both sides:\n\n$0.08x = $5.46\n\nDividing by $0.08:\n\nx = 68.25\n\nSo we need to use 68.25 pounds of the $7.28 coffee.\n\nTo check our answer, we can verify that the total weight of the mixture is:\n\nx + y = 68.25 + 7 = 75.25\n\nAnd we can verify that the average cost of the mixture is:\n\n($7.28x + $6.42(7)) / (x + 7) = ($7.28(68.25) + $6.42(7)) / (68.25 + 7) \u2248 $7.20\n\nSo our answer of using 68.25 pounds of the $7.28 coffee and 7 pounds of the $6.42 coffee is correct.",

Since equal amounts of peanuts and cashews are used, the total cost of the peanuts and cashews in each bag should be the same. The total cost of the peanuts and cashews in each bag is:\n\n2c - 0.30\n\nThe total revenue from selling each bag at $1.05 is:\n\n$1.05\n\nSo the profit per bag is:\n\n$1.05 - (2c - 0.30) = $0.75 - 2c\n\nSince 40 bags are sold, the total profit is:\n\n40($0.75 - 2c)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n$30 - 80c\n\nWe also know that the total cost of the peanuts and cashews in 40 bags is:\n\n40(2c - 0.30)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n80c - 12\n\nSince the total profit is equal to the total cost, we can set these expressions equal to each other and solve for c:\n\n$30 - 80c = 80c - 12\n\nAdding 80c to both sides:\n\n$30 = 160c - 12\n\nAdding 12 to both sides:\n\n$42 = 160c\n\nDividing by 160:\n\nc = $0.2625\n\nSo a bag of cashews is worth $0.2625.\n\nTo find the price of a bag of peanuts, we can substitute c = $0.2625 into the equation p = c - 0.30:\n\np = $0.2625 - $0.30\n\np = -$0.0375\n\nSince the price of a bag of peanuts cannot be negative, there must be an error in the problem statement or our calculation.",

The interest from the certificates of deposit is 8% of the amount invested in certificates of deposit, or 0.08c. The interest from the savings account is 6% of the amount invested in the savings account, or 0.06s. So:\n\n0.08c + 0.06s = $580\n\nWe now have two equations with two variables. We can solve this system of equations to find the values of c and s.\n\nOne way to do this is to use substitution. We can solve the first equation for one of the variables, and substitute this expression into the second equation. For example, we can solve the first equation for s:\n\ns = $8000 - c\n\nSubstituting this expression into the second equation:\n\n0.08c + 0.06($8000 - c) = $580\n\nSimplifying:\n\n0.08c + $480 - 0.06c = $580\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n0.02c + $480 = $580\n\nSubtracting $480 from both sides:\n\n0.02c = $100\n\nDividing by 0.02:\n\nc = $5000\n\nSo Kelly invested $5000 in certificates of deposit. To find the amount invested in the savings account, we can substitute this value into the first equation:\n\nc + s = $8000\n\n$5000 + s = $8000\n\nSubtracting $5000 from both sides:\n\ns = $3000\n\nSo Kelly invested $5000 in certificates of deposit and $3000 in the savings account.",

Thus, we have:\n\nx + y = 200\n\nWe also know that the resulting alloy is 10% copper by weight. Thus, the amount of copper in the alloy is:\n\n0.1(200) = 20\n\nWe can express the amount of copper in terms of x and y as follows:\n\nx + 0.075y = 20\n\nWe now have two equations with two unknowns.

After we add the water, the total volume of the mixture will be 300 mL + x.\n\nThe amount of water in the final mixture will be:\n\n0.7 (300 mL + x) = 210 mL + 0.7x\n\nThe amount of hydrochloric acid will still be 120 mL. \n\nSince the total volume of the mixture after adding water is 300 mL + x, we can set up an equation:\n\n0.7x + 210 = 0.3(300 + x)\n\nThis equation states that the amount of water in the final mixture (0.7x + 210) is equal to 30% of the total volume of the final mixture (0.3(300 + x)), which is the amount of hydrochloric acid in the mixture.\n\nNow, we can solve for x:\n\n0.7x + 210 = 90 + 0.3x\n0.4x = 120\nx = 300\n\nSo, the student needs to add 300 mL of water to the current mixture to achieve a 70% water and 30% hydrochloric acid solution.",

Similarly, pipe B can fill the pool in 12 hours, which means that in one hour it can fill 1/12 of the pool.\n\nWhen both pipes are used together, they can fill the pool at a combined rate of (1/8) + (1/12) = 5/24 of the pool per hour. To find out how long it will take to fill the pool when both pipes are used, we can set up the following equation:\n\n(5/24)x = 1\n\nwhere x is the number of hours it takes to fill the pool when both pipes are used. Solving for x, we get:\n\nx = 24/5\n\nSo it will take 4.8 hours, or 4 hours and 48 minutes, to fill the pool when both pipes are used together.",

So we can write:\n\nd = 60t   (equation 1)\n\nFor the car, it leaves two hours later than the train, so it only travels for \"t - 2\" hours (since the total time both the train and car travel is the same). The distance it travels is also equal to \"d\", and the rate is 70 miles per hour. So we can write:\n\nd = 70(t - 2)   (equation 2)\n\nNow we can solve for \"d\" by setting the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n60t = 70(t - 2)\n\n60t = 70t - 140\n\n10t = 140\n\nt = 14\n\nSo it takes 14 hours for both the train and the car to reach the town.

Since they are running in opposite directions, the distance between them is increasing at a rate equal to the sum of their speeds, or s + 2s = 3s.\n\nWe can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time\n\nto set up an equation involving the distance between them and the time they've been running. They run for 40 minutes, which is 2/3 of an hour, so we can write:\n\n16 km = (3s) \u00d7 (2/3) hour\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n16 km = 2s km/hour\n\nDividing both sides by 2, we get:\n\n8 km = s km/hour\n\nSo Pete's speed is 8 km/hour. Since Joe runs twice as fast as Pete, Joe's speed is:\n\n2s = 2(8 km/hour) = 16 km/hour\n\nTherefore, Joe runs at a speed of 16 km/hour.",

We can use the formula:\n\ndistance = rate \u00d7 time\n\nFor the trip to the retreat, the distance is \"d\", the rate is 50 miles per hour, and the time is \"t\" hours (since we don't know how long it takes to get to the retreat). So we can write:\n\nd = 50t   (equation 1)\n\nFor the trip home, the distance is also \"d\", the rate is 75 miles per hour, and the time is also \"t\" hours (since the total round trip took 10 hours and we're assuming the time to get there and back is the same). So we can write:\n\nd = 75(10 - t)   (equation 2)\n\nNow we can solve for \"d\" by setting the two expressions equal to each other:\n\n50t = 75(10 - t)\n\n50t = 750 - 75t\n\n125t = 750\n\nt = 6\n\nSo it takes 6 hours to get to the retreat, which means it takes 4 hours to get home (since the total round trip took 10 hours). We can substitute this value back into equation 1 to find the distance to the retreat:\n\nd = 50t\nd = 50(6)\nd = 300\n\nTherefore, the distance between home and the retreat is 300 miles.",

The combined rate at which both pumps can drain the lake is the sum of their individual rates, so we can write:\n\n1/9 + 1/6 = 2/18 + 3/18 = 5/18\n\nSo the two pumps together can drain 5/18 of the lake per hour. We can use the formula:\n\nrate = amount of work / time\n\nwhere \"amount of work\" is the entire lake (which is 1 in this case, since we're only interested in the relative amount of time it takes to drain the lake). So we can write:\n\n5/18 = 1 / t\n\nMultiplying both sides by t, we get:\n\nt * (5/18) = 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nt = 18/5\n\nTherefore, it takes both pumps together 18/5 hours, or 3.6 hours, to drain the lake.",

For example, the rate of the old conveyor belt is:\n\nrate of old belt = 1 / t1\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nrate of old belt = 1 / 21\n\nSimilarly, the rate of the new conveyor belt is:\n\nrate of new belt = 1 / t2\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nrate of new belt = 1 / 15\n\nThe combined rate of both conveyor belts working together is the sum of their individual rates.

    "final_answer": "Let's start by finding the rates at which each pipe can fill or empty the tank. If the inlet pipe can fill the tank in 10 hours, then its filling rate is 1/10 of the tank per hour. If the outlet pipe can empty the tank in 15 hours, then its emptying rate is 1/15 of the tank per hour. \n\nWhen both pipes are open, their combined rate is the sum of their individual rates. Since the outlet pipe is removing water from the tank, we need to subtract its rate from the inlet pipe's rate. Thus, the combined rate is:\n\n1/10 - 1/15 = 1/30\n\nThis means that the tank is being filled at a rate of 1/30 of its capacity per hour. To fill the entire tank, we need to divide the tank's capacity by the filling rate:\n\nTank capacity / filling rate = (1 / (1/30)) * (Tank capacity) = 30 * Tank capacity\n\nWe don't know the tank's capacity, but we do know that it takes 10 hours to fill it with just the inlet pipe, so:\n\nTank capacity = (1/10) * 10 = 1\n\nTherefore, the tank has a capacity of 1 unit (e.g. 1 liter, 1 gallon, etc.). Now we can find the time it takes to fill the tank with both pipes open:\n\nTime = Tank capacity / combined filling rate = 1 / (1/30) = 30\n\nSo it will take 30 hours to fill the tank with both pipes open.",

The distance to the nearest town is 100 miles, and the travel time is 60 minutes, or 1 hour:\n\n100 = (p + w) x 1\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\np + w = 100\n\nWhen the plane is traveling against the head wind, its effective speed is (p - w). The distance is the same (100 miles), but the travel time is 40 minutes longer (100 minutes, or 5/3 hours):\n\n100 = (p - w) x (5/3)\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n3p - 3w = 200\n\nNow we have two equations with two variables:\n\np + w = 100\n3p - 3w = 200\n\nWe can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination.

Here's one way to use substitution:\n\nx + y = 50    -> x = 50 - y    (subtract y from both sides)\n0.20x + 0.40y = 17    -> 0.20(50-y) + 0.40y = 17   (substitute x=50-y)\n\nNow we can simplify and solve for y:\n\n10 - 0.20y + 0.40y = 17\n0.20y = 7\ny = 35\n\nSo we know that 35 ounces of the 40% solution were used. We can plug this back into one of the equations to solve for x:\n\nx + 35 = 50\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, 15 ounces of the 20% solution were used.",

Substituting these values, we get:\n\ntime = 1 / (5/6) = 1.2 hours\n\nSo it would take Jay and Bong working together 1.2 hours, or 1 hour and 12 minutes, to paint one wall.",

Let's use t1:\n\nt1 = d/22 = 29.3/22 = 1.332...\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, we can say that it takes Juan 1.33 hours to drive to work. \n\nTo find the time it takes him to drive back home, we can subtract t1 from the total travel time:\n\nt2 = 2.25 - t1 = 2.25 - 1.33 = 0.92 hours\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, we can say that it takes Juan 0.92 hours to drive back home.\n\nTherefore, Juan's one-way distance from home to work is approximately 29.3 miles, and it takes him 1.33 hours to drive to work and 0.92 hours to drive back home.",

We know that the total distance of the biathlon is 155 miles, so we can write:\n\nr + b = 155\n\nWe also know that the time it takes to complete the race is 6 hours, and we can use this information to set up another equation. The time it takes to run a distance \"d\" at a velocity \"v\" is given by the equation:\n\ntime = distance / velocity\n\nUsing this equation for both the running and bicycle races, we can write:\n\nr / 10 + b / 29 = 6\n\nNow we have two equations in two variables, which we can solve using algebra. First, we can solve the second equation for \"r\" in terms of \"b\":\n\nr = 60 - 2.07b\n\nThen we can substitute this expression for \"r\" into the first equation:\n\n60 - 2.07b + b = 155\n\nSimplifying and solving for \"b\", we get:\n\nb = 57.08\n\nSo the distance of the bicycle race is 57.08 miles. We can substitute this value back into the equation for \"r\" to find the distance of the running race:\n\nr = 60 - 2.07(57.08) = 38.92\n\nSo the distance of the running race is 38.92 miles.
